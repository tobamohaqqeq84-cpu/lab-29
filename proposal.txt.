This program shows how plants grow over time in a small garden. Each plot in the garden has plants in three stages:
1: Seeding - newly sprouted plants
2: Growing - plants that are getting bigger 
3: Mature -fully growon plants 

The program usesan std::map to keep track of the pllots. Each plot name(like plot-A or lot-B) is the map's key. The value is a 3-element std::array pf std lists, one list for each stage.

The data about the starting plants will come from a file named data.cvs. The file will have at least 100 lines showing which plot each plant blongs to and what stage it is in.

The similation will run for 25 time period, each period:
- one plant moves from seeding to growing.
-one plant moves from groeing to mature.
-sometimes new seeds apear in seeding.

The program will print the number of lants in each stage for each plot so we see how the garden changes over time.
